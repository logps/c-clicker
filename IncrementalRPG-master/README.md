# IncrementalRPG

Incremental Game with the goal of growing and growing as much as possible. Both in the game and the growing the game itself.

The game is currently in ALPHA so it could break at any moment. Submit an issue if you do play the game and break something.

## To Do
- [ ] Remove all static information from the localStorage files. We don't need to save resource names, descriptions, etc on the user's computer. We only need to save the user specific data.
- [ ] Update to bootstrap 4 or remove bootstrap all together and make it all bespoke. (We could remove jQuery then too.)
- [ ] Better message display. Popup notifications?
- [ ] Better upgrade display? Do we need to show what upgrades have been purchased?
- [ ] Add a research time to upgrades.
- [ ] DRY the upgrades. Can I add the value the upgrade changes, the object it changes and the button HTML into the JSON object?
- [ ] If the user can't afford something, show the lacking resource in red next to its buy button.
